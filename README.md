# Cats backgrounds

This repository contains a number of backgrounds for use on HD (or better) screens.
Each cat image is accompanied by a file detailing its licence and origin.

While the repo and flake are under the MIT licence and copyright Daniel Silverstone,
each image has potentially its own licence and copyright.

Every effort has been made to provide accurate licence terms and copyrights for each
image, however if you discover that I am mistaken please contact me so that I can
correct the issue.
